# Quick SSH MCP Server Test

## 🚀 Setup (Ready to Use!)

The real SSH MCP server is compiled and ready to test with your device at `your.device.ip.address`.

### 1. Configure Cursor

Update your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-real": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/ronmiretsky/MyProjects/Test_UI/dist/real-ssh-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Restart Cursor
- Completely quit Cursor (Cmd+Q)
- Reopen Cursor
- The SSH tools should now be available

## 🔧 Available Tools

1. **ssh_connect** - Connect to SSH targets
2. **ssh_execute** - Execute commands  
3. **ssh_list_targets** - List configured targets
4. **ssh_disconnect** - Disconnect from targets

## 📝 Test Steps

### Step 1: Connect to Your Device
```json
{
  "tool": "ssh_connect",
  "arguments": {
    "host": "your.device.ip.address",
    "port": 22,
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_username"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Test Commands
Use the target ID from the connection response:

```json
{
  "tool": "ssh_execute",
  "arguments": {
    "targetId": "target_XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "command": "show system"
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Device Analysis

Based on our testing:
- ✅ **SSH Connection**: Works perfectly
- ✅ **Authentication**: `your_username/your_username` credentials work
- ⚠️ **Commands**: Standard Linux and network commands return "Invalid command"

This suggests the device has a proprietary command set. You can now use the MCP tools to:

1. **Connect** to the device
2. **Experiment** with different commands interactively
3. **Discover** what commands the device actually supports

## 💡 Command Discovery Tips

Try these types of commands through the MCP interface:

### Basic Commands
- `help`
- `?`
- `menu`
- `list`
- `status`

### Vendor-Specific Commands
- Check if it's a specific brand (Cisco, Juniper, HP, etc.)
- Try vendor-specific command formats
- Look for device documentation

### Interactive Discovery
- Use the MCP `ssh_execute` tool to try commands one by one
- The real-time feedback will help identify working commands
- Build a list of supported commands as you discover them

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Connect** using the MCP tools in Cursor
2. **Experiment** with various command formats
3. **Document** working commands you discover
4. **Automate** common tasks once you know the command set
